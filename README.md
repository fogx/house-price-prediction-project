# Group Project: Kaggle - Predicting sales prices

## description:

Many datapoints influence price negotiations for the dream house, not just the number of bedrooms or a white-picket
fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this
repository tries to predict the final price of each home, using data analysis, deep neural networks and tensorflow.

## Usage

1. Install [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html) and create a virtual environment from the
   pipfile with `pipenv install`.
2. Run the [data_engineering notebook](/code/data_engineering.ipynb) to generate the dataset.
3. Run the [modeling notebook](code/modeling.ipynb) to build the models.
